# TicTacToe

This is a simple implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe,
it's implemented in Java and it's a learning tool for me.
With the introduction of functional programming into
Java recently, this program is a tool for me to 
learn about functional programming as well as to create
a project that I can complete and be proud of. This
is to supplement my education at The University of Kent
and to give me experience in projects and documentation.

### Implementation

I've implemented this game with the ability to extend it
further down the line. For example I may change some
of the methods later to include a GUI that is nicer
than commandline.

### Comments

I've heavily commented my code and included Javadoc
throughout. Please let me know if any of these comments
are confusing.
